# This file holds the rules for analyzing the source file.

# The rules are optional, but keeping this template file in the same
# directory as the main script is recommended even if there are no rules
# to consider.

# The streamindex type was created to specifically include the dvb subtitles,
# but it can also be used for other streams (e.g. audio stream selection).

# The metadata_nfo was created to allow metadata scraping with backend-specific
# tags. For example Windows Media Center and TVHeadend provide the same metadata
# but with different keys. The metadata is stored in a .nfo (XML) file in the
# same folder as the target file. Kodi can use this local .nfo automatically.

# It should be easy to add more rule types if needed (e.g. scraping metadata from
# an external database file if it is not included in the source file).

# Each rule starts with a line that (only) has a [RULE] tag and
# ends with a line that (only) has a [/RULE] tag.

# Below are the rule fields explained followed by an example.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# RULE_DESCRIPTION =
# Non-formal title for user reminder and to enhance readability of the rule list.

# RULE_TYPE =
# Type of data to extract (streamindex/metadata_nfo supported).

# EXTRACTION_LINE_RULE_1 =
# Required. The "fingerprint" data in the ffprobe's report that distinguishes
# the selected line from every other line. Try to find a unique string.

# EXTRACTION_LINE_RULE_2 =
# User can fill here another rule that is REQUIRED TO COEXIST with EXTRACTION_LINE_RULE_1 .
# on the SAME LINE.

# EXCLUSION_LINE_RULE_1 =
# User can fill here one string that causes the line to be skipped if found.
# Useful, if the previous inclusion rules are inadequate.

# STREAM_INCLUDE_OR_EXCLUDE =
# include/exclude. Used by ffmpeg to set a "negative mapping" (e.g. -map -0:3) if exclude.

# ALLOWMULTIPLESTREAMHITS =
# Using "yes" you can skip the precaution of checking that the rule only finds one
# matching stream. Use only if the files are known to have indistinguishable streams
# (and both streams can be accepted).

# METADATA_XML_HEADER =
# Required for RULE_TYPE = metadata_nfo. Gives the field an appropriate header
# in the target .nfo -file. Don't use <> here, only the text.

# EXTRACTIONRULE_FILENAME_IFF =
# Set a single string to look for in each processed filename and apply this rule
# only with those files.

# EXTRACTIONRULE_FILENAME_IFNOT =
# Set a single string to look for in each processed filename
# and don't apply this rule with those files.

# EXTRACTIONRULE_FFPROBEREPORT_IFF =
# Set a single string to look for in ffprobe's report for each processed file
# and apply this rule in only those files.

# EXTRACTIONRULE_FFPROBEREPORT_IFNOT =
# Set a single string to look for in ffprobe's report for each processed file
# and don't apply this rule with those files.
